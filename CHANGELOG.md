# Changelog

All notable changes to pgColumnar are recorded here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). pgColumnar is
pre-release; the version marker is `1.0-dev`, recorded in `VERSION`. New tables
are written in the native on-disk format, PGCN v1. Everything below is
unreleased. For the forward-looking plan see
[design/ROADMAP.md](design/ROADMAP.md); for full history see the git log.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Column-oriented table access method (`USING pgcolumnar`) with per-column
  compression, chunk-group minimum and maximum skipping, per-chunk bloom filters,
  and a vectorized aggregate path.
- Native on-disk format PGCN v1: row groups, per-column chunks, an adaptive
  per-vector encoding cascade, zone maps for skipping, and per-chunk bloom
  filters. Delete, update, index scan, index-only scan, and projections all work
  on native tables. The earlier 1.0-dev format line has been removed; the
  `v1.0-dev` git tag preserves it.
- Compression codecs `none`, `pglz`, `lz4`, and `zstd`. `lz4` and `zstd` are
  compiled in when their system libraries are present.
- `count(*)` answered from catalog metadata without scanning.
- Parallel scan.
- Read stream prefetch in the scan on PostgreSQL 17 and later
  (`pgcolumnar.enable_read_stream`).
- Full index-only scan through a columnar visibility-map fork, with lazy `VACUUM`
  setting all-visible bits and clear-on-write, on by default
  (`pgcolumnar.enable_index_only_scan`).
- Multiple projections (C-Store model): a `pgcolumnar.projection` catalog, write
  fan-out, planner projection scan, back-fill, and vacuum coordination
  (`pgcolumnar.add_projection`, `pgcolumnar.drop_projection`,
  `pgcolumnar.enable_projection_scan`).
- Sorted storage with `pgcolumnar.vacuum_sorted`.
- Arrow IPC and Parquet export (`pgcolumnar.export_arrow`,
  `pgcolumnar.export_parquet`), self-contained with no libarrow or libparquet
  dependency. Coverage: scalar types (int2/4/8, float4/8, bool, text/varchar,
  bytea, date, time, timestamp, timestamptz, uuid, numeric, json),
  one-dimensional arrays, and composite types, with nulls at every level.
- Arrow IPC and Parquet import (`pgcolumnar.import_arrow`,
  `pgcolumnar.import_parquet`). The Parquet reader parses Thrift metadata,
  decompresses uncompressed, Snappy, GZIP, ZSTD, and LZ4_RAW pages, and decodes
  PLAIN and dictionary encodings from data-page versions 1 and 2. Both readers
  reconstruct one-dimensional arrays and composite types: Arrow from its List and
  Struct buffers, Parquet from the Dremel repetition and definition levels.
- Reading external Parquet in place. `pgcolumnar.read_parquet(path)` returns a
  file's rows without importing, `pgcolumnar.parquet_schema(path)` reports its
  columns and inferred types, and the `pgcolumnar_parquet` foreign-data wrapper
  exposes a file as a foreign table. A `path` may be a single file, a directory
  of `*.parquet` files, or a glob pattern, read as one relation in sorted order.
  The foreign scan skips row groups excluded by the query's predicate (min/max
  statistics) and decodes only the referenced columns; `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` reports
  the row groups and columns read and skipped and the number of files.
- External Parquet files are read on demand instead of loaded whole. The reader
  holds a file's footer for the scan and pulls one page at a time, so peak memory
  for raw file data is one page rather than one file. A file of 1GB or more could
  not be read at all before this, because the whole-file allocation exceeded
  `MaxAllocSize`; that ceiling is gone. A row group excluded by predicate
  pushdown is now never read from disk, and `pgcolumnar.parquet_schema` reads
  only the footer.
- A Parquet DECIMAL is also read when it is stored as an INT32 or INT64 holding
  the unscaled integer, which is how writers store small precisions;
  `pgcolumnar.parquet_schema` advises `numeric(p,s)` for those columns.
- Parquet read type coverage extended to uuid and numeric (from fixed and
  variable DECIMAL, precision up to 38), fixed-length binary, and millisecond,
  microsecond, and nanosecond time units.
- User and administrator documentation under [docs/](docs/index.md):
  installation, user guide, administration, configuration reference, SQL
  reference, and limitations.
- Benchmark harness (`bench/run_bench.sh`) covering storage size, query latency,
  vectorization, compression, sorted projection, index-only scan, projection
  scan, export, import, nested round-trip, and cross-engine reads of the Parquet
  output with DuckDB and pyarrow.
- Project logo under [logo/](logo/README.md).

### Fixed

- Bounded importer memory. `pgcolumnar.import_arrow` and `pgcolumnar.import_parquet`
  built each row's arrays and composites in one memory context and did not free
  them, using memory proportional to the row count. They now reset a per-row
  scratch context (and, for Parquet, a per-row-group context for decoded leaf
  streams), so peak memory stays bounded on large files.
- Hardened the Parquet reader against crafted files. File-declared page sizes,
  DECIMAL scale, and per-row-group column-chunk counts are range-checked, so a
  malformed footer yields a clean decode error rather than a stack overflow, an
  out-of-bounds read, or a wrong value. Float and double row-group skipping
  accounts for NaN and for inverted min/max intervals, and narrowing a wide
  Parquet value into a smaller PostgreSQL type raises instead of wrapping.
- Concurrent inserts of the same unique-index key now serialize correctly with a
  transaction-scoped advisory lock (`pgcolumnar.enable_unique_insert_lock`).
- Lost delete marks under concurrent same-chunk-group deletes.
- Relation-reference leak in parallel `CREATE INDEX`.

### Compatibility

- Builds from one source tree on PostgreSQL 15 through 19. Every test suite runs
  on all five majors.
- The Arrow and Parquet import and export functions require superuser and run on
  little-endian hosts.
